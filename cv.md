## Junior Software Engineer

Started learning programming languages 5 years ago. I passed courses of C, C++, C# and JavaScript. In 2018 attended RSSchool and made final project. After that decided to develop career in recruitment and became Talent Acquisition Manager of US TA team at EPAM. Now I would like to refresh my knowledge and learn more in programming.
